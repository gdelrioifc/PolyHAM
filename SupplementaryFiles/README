<p>This directory contains 36 files that are supplementary to the original work entitled "Machine-learning classification of polypharmacologic human-targeted and antimicrobial chemical compounds".</p>

<p>These 36 files are grouped in three sets:</p>
<ul>
<li> 3 files in TSV format with the compound ID, name and SMILES formula: SupplementaryFileS1,S2 and S3.</li>
<li> 28 files in ARFF format, with the attributes for each of the compounds derived from the 3 TSV files: SupplementaryFileS4-S27 </li>
<li> 3 files in txt format, corresponding to the scripts needed to execute WEKA's best models cross-validation test for each training set: SupplementaryFileS28,29,30.</li>

<p>Some of the files are too large and were splitted into two halves (a and b); to use them, simple add part b at the end of part a.</p>
