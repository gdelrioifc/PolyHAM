This directory contains 36 files that are supplementary to the original work entitled "Machine-learning classification of polypharmacologic human-targeted and antimicrobial chemical compounds".
These 36 files are grouped in three sets:
i) 3 files in TSV format with the compound ID, name and SMILES formula: SupplementaryFileS1,S2 and S3.
ii) 28 files in ARFF format, with the attributes for each of the compounds derived from the 3 TSV files: SupplementaryFileS4-S27
iii) 3 files in txt format, corresponding to the scripts needed to execute WEKA's best models cross-validation test for each training set: SupplementaryFileS28,29,30.
